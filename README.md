# Weather Dashboard

## A dashboard to search the weather by city.

I created this dashboard as a simple way for a user to search for the current and 5-day forcast of their chosen city. With a single seach a user can find the weather wherever they want!

In the course of this project I learn about the OpenWeather API and what forcast information is available through it.


## Installation

This is a web application and requires no installation.

## Usage

To use the weather dashboard, enter a city in the search bar and hit the search button. This will display the current forcast for the day as well the forcast for the following five days. To review the results for a previously searched city, click the gray button with the name of the city you wish to return to. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
